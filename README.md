Battleships tech test

Today, you'll practice doing a tech test.

For most tech tests, you'll essentially have unlimited time. For this one, there will be a light time pressure. See what you can get done in four hours.

You'll get to practice your OO design and TDD skills.

You'll work alone, and you'll also review your own code so you can practice reflecting on and improving your own work.

Schedule

09.30 - 14.00. Work solo to implement the Battleship user stories in Ruby. Have breaks whenever you like.

14.00 - 14.20. Review your own code. Look for places it could be refactored.

14.20 - 15.00. Refactor your code.

15.00 - 16.00. We'll all come together and review our code on the projector.
